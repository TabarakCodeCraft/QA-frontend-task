🎨 Features Overview
Dashboard Features

User Statistics: Total users, average age, average salary, departments
User Table: Sortable, searchable, and filterable user list
User Actions: View details, edit, delete (role-based)

User Management

Search & Filter: Find users by name, email, role, or department

Security Features

JWT Authentication: Secure token-based authentication
Password Security: Bcrypt hashing for password protection
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse with configurable rate limits
Input Validation: Comprehensive server-side validation
Role-based Access: Different permissions based on user roles

🚦 Usage

Login: Use one of the default credentials to log in
Dashboard: View user statistics and browse the user list
Add User: Click "Add User" to create a new user (admin only)
Edit User: Click the edit icon to modify user information
View Details: Click the eye icon to see detailed user information
Search: Use the search bar to find specific users
Filter: Use table filters to narrow down the user list

🔒 Security Considerations

All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
Input validation prevents injection attacks
CORS properly configured for frontend access
Helmet.js provides security headers

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues

"Route not found" error

Ensure you're accessing the correct API endpoints
Check if the backend server is running


Authentication errors

Verify JWT_SECRET is set in environment variables
Check if token has expired (24-hour expiry)


CORS errors

Ensure frontend and backend URLs are properly configured
Check CORS settings in the backend



📝 Development Notes

The backend uses in-memory storage for demo purposes
For production, integrate with a proper database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
Environment variables should be properly secured in production
Consider implementing refresh token mechanism for enhanced security
